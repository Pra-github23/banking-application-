# banking-application-
a Banking Application with key features such as:

✅ Account Creation
✅ Deposit & Withdrawal
✅ Account Deletion
✅ Retrieve Single/All Accounts

This project was built using Spring Boot, ensuring smooth backend operations and security for handling financial transactions. Here's a breakdown of how I approached it:

Spring Boot: Core framework for creating a fast and efficient RESTful API.
Postman: Used to test and interact with the API endpoints (Create, Deposit, Withdraw, Delete, Get Account, etc.).
Database Integration: Utilized a simple in-memory database (H2) to store account details and transactions.
Security: Implemented basic security features to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
RESTful Design: Followed REST principles for clean and scalable API endpoints.
Key Features:
🏦 Create Account: Enables users to create a new bank account with essential details.
💳 Deposit & Withdraw: Users can deposit and withdraw funds from their accounts, ensuring proper transaction flow.
🗑 Delete Account: Users can delete their account securely, with all associated data handled appropriately.
📊 Get Account: Retrieve account details for any user.
📑 Get All Accounts: List all accounts for administrative purposes.
I used Postman for testing each API endpoint to ensure everything works smoothly and as expected. This project was a great way to practice and reinforce my skills in Spring Boot, RESTful API design, database integration, and security.
